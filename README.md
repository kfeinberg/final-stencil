# Final Project

To run the code, use a department machine or a personal computer with the standard
Qt installation.

## Moving the Camera:
Up, down, left, right arrow- "moves" the camera in this direction. The camera itself isn't moved, but its
like turning your head in the direction you press on your keyboard.

W key- moves the camera 1 unit forwards- this actually moves the camera's position
S key- moves the camera 1 unit backwards- also moves the camera
